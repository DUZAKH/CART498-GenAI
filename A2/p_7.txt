"One must have a mind of her
To regard the frost and the death
Of the pinetrees crusted with salt
And have been cold a long way
To behold the junipers shagged with white
The spruces rough in the distant horizon
Of the January sun and not to speak
Of any misery in the sound of the sound
In the sound of a few shots
Which is the sound of the voice
Full of the same day
That is blowing in the same bare air
For the listener who listens in the second
And nothing himself has
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that isn
One must have a mind of her
To regard the frost and the death
Of the pinetrees crusted with salt
And have been cold a long way
To behold the junipers shagged with white
The spruces rough in the distant horizon
Of the January sun and not to speak
Of any misery in the sound of the sound
In the sound of a few shots
Which is the sound of the voice
Full of the same day
That is blowing in the same bare air
For the listener who listens in the second
And nothing himself has
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that isn"
