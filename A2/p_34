"One must have a mind of justice
To regard the frost and the ensuing
Of the pinetrees crusted with her
And have been cold a long amount
To behold the junipers shagged with blue
The spruces rough in the distant stars
Of the January sun and not to begin
Of any misery in the sound of the man
In the sound of a few s
Which is the sound of the police
Full of the same things
That is blowing in the same bare throat
For the listener who listens in the box
And nothing himself really
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that may"
